# Student Performance Prediction with Machine Learning

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX)

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes
**Platform:** Google Colab or SageMaker Studio Lab
**Cost:** $0 (no AWS account needed)
**Data:** Synthetic educational dataset (~100MB)

## Research Goal

Build predictive models to identify at-risk students and forecast academic performance using educational data including grades, attendance, demographics, and engagement metrics. Apply machine learning for early warning systems and personalized intervention recommendations.

## Quick Start

### Run in Google Colab
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR_USERNAME/research-jumpstart/blob/main/projects/education/learning-analytics-platform/tier-0/student-prediction.ipynb)

### Run in SageMaker Studio Lab
[![Open in SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/import/github/YOUR_USERNAME/research-jumpstart/blob/main/projects/education/learning-analytics-platform/tier-0/student-prediction.ipynb)

## What You'll Build

1. **Load educational dataset** (~100MB synthetic student data)
2. **Exploratory data analysis** (achievement gaps, attendance patterns, correlation analysis)
3. **Feature engineering** (GPA trends, engagement scores, risk indicators)
4. **Train dropout prediction model** (XGBoost classifier, 15-20 minutes)
5. **Grade forecasting** (regression model for next semester GPA)
6. **Evaluate and interpret** (feature importance, fairness metrics, intervention recommendations)

## Dataset

**Synthetic Student Performance Data**
- Size: 10,000 students × 50+ features
- Timespan: 4 years (8 semesters)
- Features:
  - Academic: Grades, GPA, course enrollment, test scores
  - Behavioral: Attendance rate, tardiness, suspensions
  - Engagement: LMS logins, assignment completion, participation
  - Demographic: Age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, ELL status, IEP
  - Outcomes: Graduation status, dropout risk, college enrollment
- Format: CSV with longitudinal structure
- **Note:** Synthetic data to protect student privacy (FERPA compliant)

## Colab Considerations

This notebook works on Colab but you'll notice:
- **Small dataset** (10K students vs. district-wide 50K+)
- **Limited temporal depth** (4 years vs. comprehensive K-12)
- **Basic models only** (XGBoost, no deep learning HLM)
- **No real-time updates** (static snapshot vs. continuous monitoring)
- **Simple fairness analysis** (basic bias detection)

These limitations become critical for production educational analytics systems.

## What's Included

- Single Jupyter notebook (`student-prediction.ipynb`)
- Synthetic student data generation
- Feature engineering pipeline
- XGBoost dropout prediction model
- Grade forecasting regression
- Model interpretation (SHAP values)
- Fairness and bias analysis

## Key Methods

- **Classification:** XGBoost for dropout prediction
- **Regression:** Random Forest for grade forecasting
- **Feature Engineering:** Temporal aggregations, trend analysis
- **Imbalanced Learning:** SMOTE, class weighting
- **Model Interpretation:** SHAP values, partial dependence plots
- **Fairness Analysis:** Disparate impact, equalized odds

## Prediction Outputs

1. **Dropout Risk Score:** Probability of not completing (0-1 scale)
2. **Grade Forecast:** Next semester GPA prediction with confidence interval
3. **Risk Factors:** Top 10 features contributing to risk
4. **Intervention Recommendations:** Targeted support strategies
5. **Fairness Metrics:** Performance across demographic subgroups

## Next Steps

**Need district-scale analytics?** This project shows basic concepts:

- **Tier 1:** [District-wide learning analytics](../tier-1/) on Studio Lab
  - 50,000+ students with full longitudinal data
  - Hierarchical linear models (HLM) for growth trajectories
  - Value-added modeling for teacher effectiveness
  - Multi-year trend analysis

- **Tier 2:** [AWS-integrated platform](../tier-2/) with data pipelines
  - Real-time data integration (SIS, LMS, assessments)
  - Automated daily model updates with Lambda
  - SageMaker for production ML pipelines
  - S3 data lake for multi-year historical data

- **Tier 3:** [Production analytics platform](../tier-3/) with CloudFormation
  - State-wide deployment (1M+ students)
  - Real-time dashboards with QuickSight
  - Automated early warning alerts
  - Integration with intervention systems
  - FERPA-compliant data governance

## Requirements

Pre-installed in Colab and Studio Lab:
- Python 3.9+
- pandas, numpy, scipy
- scikit-learn, xgboost
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- shap (model interpretation)
- imbalanced-learn

**Privacy Note:** All data is synthetic. Real student data requires IRB approval and FERPA compliance.
